      version: "1.0"
      title: "Provide that public elections are publicly funded"

To close the revolving door, members of Congress should have to wait at least ten years before they are allowed to work as lobbyists."

      body: "The Supreme Court has give artificial entities, like corporations, constitutional rights. But constitutional rights should be reserved to persons, only. A collective has the rights of the people within it, but no more."
